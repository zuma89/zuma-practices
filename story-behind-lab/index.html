					<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
					<h4>If you can recall, there was once Dr.W called for a meeting on Saturday noon. During that meeting he assigned a couple of tasks and projects to some of his undergraduate students who did their final year project under his supervision and H. Dr.W too promise that all the sales of those project will be put into a fund and the author of those projects can take up royalty for every successfully sold project. Once the fund reach a certain amount he will start a company and distribute shares to the people involved in helping to form the company. H was assigned to build an Augmented Reality application as a snippet which is capable to embed into websites or web applications and run any web browsers. After a couple of weeks of hard work coding in the laboratory finally the product is ready. H handed the industrial product to Dr.W and Dr.W made an appointment to bring H and his friend to the work site to put up those codes. H was over the moon when he heard Dr.W words because H never been to that work site after 3 years studying in the university.</h4>

					<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
					<br/>
					<h4>2 weeks before final year project presentation, H's senior, X, saw H and his friends programming Augmented Reality project so X started to discuss about Augmented Reality applications with H. Through the discussion H was being told that for the past so many years all the projects that H's seniors did with Dr. W, they got nothing in return. A few months ago, Dr.W even cut his grant from 1500MYR per month to 500MYR and recent 2 months Dr.W delayed the grant that he should give to X. X have finished his postgraduate studies many months ago but yet Dr.W is still holding back his thesis and doesn't allow X to graduate and hunt for job in the market. H tried to defend Dr.W by telling X this time Dr.W said he will distribute shares, X stood up smile, shrugged his shoulders and walked away.</h4>
